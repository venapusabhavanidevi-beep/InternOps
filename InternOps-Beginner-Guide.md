## 1. What You're Working With

Before touching anything, know these words:

| Term                  | Meaning                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Git**               | A tool installed on your computer that tracks changes to code over time.                                  |
| **GitHub**            | A website that stores Git projects online so teams can share and collaborate.                             |
| **Repository (repo)** | A project's folder, tracked by Git. InternOps is a repo.                                                  |
| **Clone**             | Downloading a copy of a repo from GitHub onto your computer.                                              |
| **Node.js**           | A program that lets JavaScript run outside a browser — needed to run this project's backend and frontend. |
| **npm**               | Comes bundled with Node.js. It downloads and manages the code "packages" (libraries) a project needs.     |
| **Python**            | Required for the new standalone AI Service, managing LLM integrations and logic.                          |
| **Branch**            | A separate, isolated line of work in Git so you don't mess up the main code while making changes.         |
| **Commit**            | A saved snapshot of your changes, with a message describing what you did.                                 |
| **Push**              | Uploading your commits from your computer to GitHub.                                                      |
| **Pull Request (PR)** | A formal request asking the team to review and merge your branch into the main project.                   |
| **Issue**             | A tracked task, bug, or feature request on GitHub. This is usually where "tasks" live.                    |

InternOps itself is a workforce-management platform with:

- **Backend**: Node.js + Fastify + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
- **AI Service**: Python + FastAPI/LLM Integrations

You don't need to understand all of that yet — just know there are three folders, `backend`, `frontend`, and `ai-service`, and each is set up separately.

---

## 2. Installing Node.js

The project needs **Node.js version 18 or higher**.

### Windows / macOS

1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download the **LTS** version (the big green button — LTS means "Long Term Support," it's the stable one).
3. Run the installer and click Next through all the default options.
4. Restart your computer (recommended, not always required).

### Verify it worked

Open a terminal:

- **Windows**: search "PowerShell" in the Start menu and open it.
- **macOS**: open "Terminal" from Spotlight (Cmd+Space, type Terminal).

Type:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see version numbers like `v20.11.0` and `10.2.4`. If you see "command not found," restart your terminal, and if that fails, restart your computer.

---

## 2.5 Installing Python

The project uses Python for its AI Service.

### Windows / macOS

1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the latest version (e.g., Python 3.10 or newer).
3. Run the installer. **CRITICAL FOR WINDOWS**: Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking Install.
4. Finish the install.

### Verify it worked

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
python --version
```

(If that fails, try `python3 --version`). You should see something like `Python 3.12.2`.

---

## 3. Installing Git

### Windows

1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Download starts automatically. Run the installer.
3. Click Next on every screen using the **default options** (the defaults are fine for beginners — don't overthink the settings).
4. Finish the install.

### macOS

Open Terminal and type:

```bash
git --version
```

If Git isn't installed, macOS will prompt you to install "Command Line Developer Tools" — click Install.

### Verify it worked

In your terminal (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS):

```bash
git --version
```

You should see something like `git version 2.44.0`.

---

## 4. Creating a GitHub Account

1. Go to https://github.com/signup
2. Enter your email, create a password, and pick a username (this username will be publicly visible — pick something professional, e.g. your real name or a variant of it).
3. Verify your email via the link GitHub sends you.

---

## 5. Setting Up Git on Your Computer

Git needs to know who you are before you can commit any code. This is a **one-time setup**.

Open your terminal and run these two commands, replacing the name/email with your own (use the **same email as your GitHub account**):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Verify it saved correctly:

```bash
git config --global --list
```

You should see `user.name` and `user.email` listed.

---

## 6. Connecting Git to GitHub (Authentication)

When you try to push code, GitHub needs to verify it's really you. If you're using **VS Code** (recommended), this is the easiest possible method — no tokens to create or copy-paste.

### Main method: Sign in through VS Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Click the **Accounts** icon in the bottom-left corner → **Sign in with GitHub**.
   - Alternatively, open the **Source Control** tab (left sidebar) → click **Publish Branch** or **Sign in** when prompted.
3. Your web browser opens automatically, showing a GitHub authorization page. Log in if needed, then click **Authorize Visual-Studio-Code**.
4. Return to VS Code — you're now signed in. Git operations you do from VS Code's Source Control panel, or even its built-in terminal, will authenticate automatically. No token, no repeated password prompts.

That's it — you can skip straight to [Section 7](#7-downloading-cloning-the-internops-project).

### Alternative: Personal Access Token (PAT)

If you're working purely from a terminal outside VS Code (or VS Code's sign-in isn't working), use **HTTPS with a Personal Access Token**:

#### Step 1 — Create a Personal Access Token

1. Log in to GitHub → click your profile picture (top right) → **Settings**.
2. Scroll down the left sidebar → **Developer settings**.
3. Click **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)** → **Generate new token (classic)**.
4. Give it a name like `internops-laptop`.
5. Set an expiration (90 days is a safe beginner default).
6. Under "Select scopes," check **repo** (this gives it permission to read/write your repos).
7. Click **Generate token**.
8. **Copy the token immediately** — GitHub only shows it once. Paste it somewhere safe (like a password manager or a private note) — you'll use it as your "password" when Git asks.

#### Step 2 — Use it

The first time you `git push` or `git pull` from a private/authenticated action, a window (or terminal prompt) will ask for your GitHub username and password:

- **Username**: your GitHub username
- **Password**: paste the **token**, not your actual GitHub password

Git/your OS will usually remember it after the first time (via "credential manager").

> **Alternative (more advanced): SSH keys.** If your team prefers SSH, ask your mentor — it avoids re-entering tokens but requires a few extra setup steps (`ssh-keygen`, adding the public key to GitHub under Settings → SSH and GPG keys).

> **Alternative: GitHub Desktop.** If you're not using VS Code and typing tokens into a terminal feels intimidating, install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) instead. Sign in with your GitHub account through its UI once, and it handles all authentication for you.

---

## 7. Downloading (Cloning) the InternOps Project

InternOps uses a **fork-based workflow** — you work on your own copy of the repo (a "fork") rather than the original directly.

1. Go to https://github.com/rajat-wyrm/InternOps and click **Fork** (top-right of the page) to create your own copy under your GitHub account.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want the project to live, e.g.:

```bash
cd Documents
mkdir Projects
cd Projects
```

3. Clone **your fork** (not the original):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/InternOps.git
```

4. Move into the project folder:

```bash
cd InternOps
```

5. Set up your remotes. Cloning your fork automatically names it `origin`. You also need a link to the **original** repo so you can pull in updates the team makes — this is conventionally called `upstream`:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rajat-wyrm/InternOps.git
```

Verify both remotes are set correctly:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see four lines: `origin` pointing to your fork (fetch + push) and `upstream` pointing to `rajat-wyrm/InternOps` (fetch + push).

> **Why this matters:** `origin` is where _you_ push your work. `upstream` is where you pull _the team's_ latest changes from, so your fork doesn't fall behind. Before starting a new task, sync with:
>
> ```bash
> git checkout master
> git pull upstream master
> git push origin master
> ```

You now have a full local copy of the project, linked to both your fork and the original repo.

---

## 8. Understanding the Project Structure

```
InternOps/
├── .github/workflows/     # CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions)
├── ai-service/             # Standalone Python AI Service
├── backend/                # Node.js + Fastify + PostgreSQL API
├── frontend/                # React + Vite + TailwindCSS UI
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── project-structure.txt   # Detailed folder breakdown
├── docker-compose.prod.yml
├── docker-compose.prod.yml
└── README.md
```

As a beginner, you'll spend most of your time inside `backend/`, `frontend/`, or `ai-service/`, depending on what you're assigned.

---

## 9. Installing Project Dependencies

Every Node.js project has a `package.json` file listing the libraries it needs, plus a `package-lock.json` that pins the **exact** versions everyone on the team is using.

For this first install, use `npm ci` (not `npm install`). It reads `package-lock.json` and installs those exact versions — guaranteeing your setup matches everyone else's, and it's faster too.

From the project root:

```bash
cd backend
npm ci
```

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm ci
```

This creates a `node_modules` folder in each — that's normal, it's just the downloaded libraries (never edit files inside it, and never commit it — it's already excluded via `.gitignore`).

> **`npm ci` vs `npm install`:** Use `npm ci` whenever you're doing a fresh install from an existing `package-lock.json` (like right now) — it's stricter and reproducible. Use `npm install` only when you're _adding or updating_ a package yourself, since that's the command that actually modifies `package.json`/`package-lock.json`. If `npm ci` ever fails with a lock-file error, ask your team lead before running `npm install` to "fix" it — the lock file may be intentionally different from what you expect.

---

## 10. Setting Up Environment Variables

The backend needs secret configuration (database URL, JWT secret, etc.) that should **never** be committed to Git. This lives in a `.env` file.

1. Inside `backend/`, look for a file called `.env.example`.
2. Copy it to a new file named `.env`:

```powershell
cd backend
copy .env.example .env      # Windows PowerShell
# or on macOS/Linux:
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Open `.env` in any code editor (VS Code recommended) and fill in real values. At minimum you'll need:

| Variable       | What it is                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Your PostgreSQL connection string                  |
| `JWT_SECRET`   | Any long random string (used to sign login tokens) |
| `PORT`         | Leave as `5000` unless told otherwise              |
| `NODE_ENV`     | `development` while you're working locally         |

See Section 11 to create your own free Neon database and get this value.

---

## 11. Setting Up the Database

InternOps uses **PostgreSQL**, and this project's dev database is hosted on **Neon** (a free, cloud-hosted Postgres) — so you don't need to install Postgres on your own machine.

### Step 1 — Get your database connection string

Create your own free Neon project:

1. Go to https://neon.tech and sign up (you can use your GitHub account to sign in).
2. Click **Create a project**. Give it any name, e.g. `internops-dev`.
3. When asked to choose a **region** for the server, select **Singapore**.
4. Once created, go to your project's **Dashboard** → look for **Connection string** (sometimes under "Connection Details").
5. Copy the connection string — it looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@ep-something-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```

### Step 2 — Add it to your `.env` file

Open `backend/.env` (created in Section 10) and paste the connection string as your `DATABASE_URL`:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@ep-something-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

> **Important — Neon-specific fix:** InternOps needs one extra parameter appended to the end of the URL for Neon to work correctly: `&uselibpqcompat=true`. So the full line should look like:
>
> ```
> DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@ep-something-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&uselibpqcompat=true
> ```
>
> If you skip this, you may see connection errors or timeouts later (see Section 17).

### Step 3 — Create the tables and seed data

Once `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` is correct, from `backend/`:

```bash
# Run from inside backend/
npm run migrate

# OR from project root using workspaces:
npm run migrate --workspace=backend
```

This creates all the necessary tables. It's safe to run more than once — it skips anything already applied.

```bash
# Run from inside backend/
npm run seed

# OR from project root:
npm run seed --workspace=backend
```

This creates a default admin account: `admin@internops.com` / `Admin@123` (for local testing only).

> **Tip:** If either command fails, double-check there are no extra spaces or line breaks in your `DATABASE_URL`, and that it starts with `postgresql://`.

---

## 12. Running the Project

### Start the backend

```bash
# Run from inside backend/
cd backend
npm run dev

# OR run from the project root using workspaces:
npm run dev --workspace=backend
```

This starts the API server (auto-restarts when you save a file). Visit `http://localhost:5000/docs` to see the Swagger API documentation.

### Start the frontend (in a **separate** terminal window)

```bash
# Run from inside frontend/
cd frontend
npm run dev

# OR run from the project root:
npm run dev --workspace=frontend
```

This gives you a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to view the app in your browser.

> Keep both terminals open while working — closing them stops the servers.

### Start the AI Service (in a **third** terminal window)

```bash
cd ai-service
```

Create a virtual environment (one-time setup):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

- Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
- macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your AI keys inside `.env` to test the AI features locally. Then, run the entry point command to start the AI API.

---

## 13. Git Basics — Branches, Commits, Pushing

**Golden rule: never write new code directly on `master`.** Always create a new branch first.

### Step-by-step for every task:

**1. Make sure your local `master` is up to date with the original repo:**

```bash
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master
```

**2. Create a new branch for your task:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/short-task-description
```

Naming convention examples: `feature/notice-board-ui`, `fix/csrf-bug`, `chore/update-readme`.

**3. Make your code changes** in your editor as normal.

**4. Check what changed:**

```bash
git status
```

**5. Stage your changes** (tell Git which files to include in the next commit):

```bash
git add .
```

(`.` means "all changed files" — or name a specific file instead, e.g. `git add backend/routes/tasks.js`.)

**6. Commit with a clear message:**

```bash
git commit -m "Fix: correct CSRF token validation on task creation"
```

**7. Push your branch to GitHub:**

```bash
git push origin feature/short-task-description
```

The first time you push a new branch, Git may show you the exact command to run — just copy-paste it if it differs slightly.

---

## 14. How to Find or Create a Task

InternOps tracks work using **GitHub Issues**.

### To find a task:

1. Go to https://github.com/rajat-wyrm/InternOps/issues
2. Browse open issues. Look for labels like `good first issue`, `bug`, or `enhancement` if available.
3. Comment on the issue saying you'd like to work on it (avoids two people doing the same task).
4. Ask your team lead if issues are assigned differently (e.g., via a task board/Notice Board feature in the app itself, or Slack/Discord).

### To create a task:

1. Go to the **Issues** tab → click **New issue**.
2. Give it a clear title, e.g. "Bug: Notification count not updating after mark-as-read."
3. In the description, explain:
   - What's wrong / what's needed
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
4. Add labels if you have permission, and assign yourself if you're doing the work.
5. Click **Submit new issue**.

---

## 15. How to Do a Pull Request (PR)

A Pull Request is how you propose merging your branch's changes into `master` so the team can review before it goes live. Since InternOps uses a fork-based workflow (Section 7), your PR goes from your fork's branch into the original repo's `master`.

1. Do your branch/commit work as in Section 13, then push to **your fork** (`origin`):

```bash
git push origin feature/short-task-description
```

2. Go to your fork on GitHub → **Contribute** → **Open pull request**. This creates a PR from your fork's branch into the original repo's `master`.
3. Fill in:
   - **Title**: short summary, e.g. "Fix CSRF validation bug in task creation"
   - **Description**: what you changed, why, and how to test it. Reference the issue if there is one, e.g. `Closes #42`.
4. Click **Create pull request**.
5. Wait for a reviewer (usually the maintainer/team lead) to review. They may:
   - Approve and merge it
   - Request changes — go back to your branch, make edits, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` again (it auto-updates the same PR)
6. Once merged, delete your branch and start fresh from `master` for your next task.

> Note: as of this writing, the InternOps README states external contributions aren't accepted — so this workflow applies to internal team members with fork/PR access rather than the general public. Confirm the exact process with your team lead.

## 17. Common Problems & Fixes

| Problem                                           | Fix                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git: command not found`                          | Restart your terminal/computer after installing Git.                                                                                                                |
| `npm: command not found`                          | Node.js isn't installed correctly — reinstall from nodejs.org.                                                                                                      |
| Push asks for password repeatedly                 | Use your Personal Access Token (Section 6), not your actual GitHub password.                                                                                        |
| `Permission denied (publickey)`                   | You're trying to use SSH without a configured key — switch to the HTTPS clone URL instead.                                                                          |
| Merge conflicts when pulling                      | Open the conflicted file(s), look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers, manually decide what to keep, delete the markers, then `git add .` and `git commit`. |
| Backend won't start — `Plugin must be a function` | Ensure `app.register()` calls receive a function, not an object (per InternOps README troubleshooting).                                                             |
| Migrations fail with BOM error                    | Regenerate the SQL file without a byte-order-mark; the migration runner strips BOM automatically but source files should be BOM-free.                               |
