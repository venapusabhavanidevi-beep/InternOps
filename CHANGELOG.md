# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

- Profile image removal with confirmation, default-avatar fallback, persistent backend cleanup, and success/error feedback.

### Added

- Sentiment analysis pipeline for customer feedback (`ai-service/app/sentiment/`): labeled 180-example dataset, text preprocessing with negation handling, TF-IDF + logistic-regression baseline, training/evaluation CLI (`python -m app.sentiment.train`), recorded metrics (`ai-service/reports/sentiment/metrics.json`) and a write-up in `docs/SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS.md`. `scikit-learn` added to the ai-service dev dependencies only.
- API versioning infrastructure: all business routes are now namespaced under `/api/v1/` (`app.js`).
- `src/routes.v2.js` skeleton for future breaking changes — registered at `/api/v2/` alongside the stable v1 router.
- `Deprecation`, `Sunset`, and `Link` response headers on all v1 routes when `V1_DEPRECATED=true` env var is set (`src/routes.js`).
- Swagger `servers` block now lists both `/api/v1` and `/api/v2` entries.
- Three API versioning env vars documented in `backend/.env.example` (`V1_DEPRECATED`, `V1_DEPRECATION_DATE`, `V1_SUNSET_DATE`).
- API Versioning Policy section in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (90-day sunset window, deprecation header format, v2 introduction guide).

### Fixed

- Avatar URLs now resolve against the API origin, fixing broken profile images in production where the frontend and API are on separate origins ([#1865](https://github.com/rajat-wyrm/InternOps/issues/1865)).
